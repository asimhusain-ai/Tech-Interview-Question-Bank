## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by company name, and within each company's folder, the problems are categorized by the primary data structure or algorithm involved.

Each problem file (`.md`) contains:
* **Problem Statement**: A clear description of the problem.
* **Link**: A direct link to the problem on a platform like LeetCode, HackerRank, or GeeksforGeeks.
* **Difficulty**: Easy / Medium / Hard.
* **Solution Approach**: An explanation of the logic and algorithm used.
* **Code**: A clean, well-commented solution in one or more languages (e.g., Python, C++, Java, JavaScript).

    - **Difficulty:** Medium

    ---

    ### Solution Approach

    A brief explanation of the logic. For example:
    We can solve this using a hash map to store numbers we've seen and their indices. For each element, we check if its complement (`target - element`) is in the map.
